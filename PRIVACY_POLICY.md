# Privacy Policy — Epoch Buddy

Last updated: 2026-02-03

Epoch Buddy (“the extension”) is designed to work fully locally in your browser.

## Data collection

Epoch Buddy does **not** collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal data.

Specifically, the extension does **not** collect:

- Personally identifiable information (name, email, identifiers)
- Authentication information (passwords, credentials)
- Financial, health, or location information
- Web history or browsing activity
- Page contents (beyond the user’s current selection used for conversion)

## Data storage

Epoch Buddy uses browser local storage (`browser.storage.local` / equivalent) only to store **your recent conversion history** (up to the last 10 conversions) so it can be displayed in the extension popup.

This history data remains on your device and is not transmitted anywhere.

You can remove this data at any time using the **Clear history** button in the extension.

## Permissions

- **Storage**: Used to store recent conversion history locally.
- **Host access (`<all_urls>` via content scripts)**: Used to enable the “highlight/select an epoch on any webpage and convert” feature. The extension reads only the text you select to perform the conversion and display the result.

## Third-party services

Epoch Buddy does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, advertising, or remote servers.

## Changes to this policy

If the extension’s data practices change in the future, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.

## Contact

If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please open an issue on the project repository.
